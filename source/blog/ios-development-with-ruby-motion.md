I've been building an iOS app with RubyMotion for a while now, and the verdict is...

I'm in love with [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/).

Here's why:

* Ruby syntax runs circles around Objective-C syntax. If you've used Ruby and Objective-C for anything significant, and you're not a masochist, then you know what I'm talking about.
* It already has some amazing libraries like Teacup, BubbleWrap, and Formotion.
* Building and deploying is a cinch with Rake. There's even a testflight gem.
* Bundler and CocoaPods for dependency management.
* The REPL. I actually haven't found this that big of a deal, but it can come in handy now and then.
* I can continue using a text editor (vim or Sublime Text) instead of that hog called Xcode.
* Really small archives.
* The only (minor) downside so far has been occasionally translating example Objective-C code to RubyMotion code from Apple's docs and Stack Overflow.
