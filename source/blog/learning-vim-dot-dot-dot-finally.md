I had the opportunity to work with a bunch of TDD vim hackers during the last 4-5 months over at Nulogy, and after some initial resistance I decided to jump in and learn vim. My motivation is to really see if it lives up to the hype, and more importantly because it'll make me look like a genius to the layman watching my screen (I.e. [Gary Bernhardt](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com)).

I've tackled vim a few times over the years, but never fully committed to it. Since I believe you need to fully commit to something to do it well (including learning anything), I decided to pick up my touch typing first to really see the benefits of VIM.

Last week I achieved my typing goal of 75 words per minute, inspiration courtesy of [Steve Yegge](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.ca/2008/09/programmings-dirtiest-little-secret.html). I've since upped my goal to 90 wpm, but I think I'm at least quick enough now to really immerse myself into learning vim.

I'm starting with [Peepcode's Smash Into Vim](https://peepcode.com/products/smash-into-vim-i), this [Yehuda post](http://yehudakatz.com/2010/07/29/everyone-who-tried-to-convince-me-to-use-vim-was-wrong/), and of course the built in vim tutor.

Rock on!
