## Product

Curling Canada captures scoring for the largest curling competitions in the world.

A curling fan's first stop for live game results in real time is Curling Canada's site and the various regional curling organizations like CURLSASK and Ontario Curling Association.

In order to provide this fan experience they need to manage, capture, and report on all of their own as well as each regional association's competitions.


## Challenge

Curling Canada needed an interface to:

* Register and define competitions like "The Briars".
* Assign teams.
* Compose round robin and bracket formats.
* Schedule games.
* Capture scoring for all of their games.
* Deliver these results in real-time on various Word Press sites.
