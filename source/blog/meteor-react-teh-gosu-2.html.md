This is part two of a series of posts that go through creating a new web app with Meteor and React.

[You can find part one here](meteor-react-teh-gosu-1.html.md)

## Setting Up the Data

Meteor officially backs on to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/).
Other integrations like [PostgreSQL](http://meteor-postgres.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) are in the works, but unreleased at the time of this post.

MongoDB is a document database which organizes documents into collections.
You can think of a collection as a table and a document as a row, only less tructured.


This concludes part two of our Meteor + React series.
In part three we'll add some routing.
